my genome networking code

run updatedtest.py, and it should prompt you to enter a rep threshold and cp threshold (rep is more varied than cp, so it would be a good idea to reduce rep threshold to 10 below the cp thresholde, ie. 30,40). if you type y for edges, the red lines represent rep pi values, the blue lines represent cp pi values, and the purple lines represent an average of both! Right click on nodes(circles) or edges(lines) to get additional data.
