# networks
my genome networking code

run updatedtest.py, and it should prompt you to enter a rep threshold and cp threshold from 0 to 100 (the rep protein is more varied than the cp protein, so it would be a good idea to reduce rep threshold to below the cp threshold, ie. rep: 30,cp: 40). if you type y for edges, the red lines represent only rep pi values between the two cruciviruses, the blue lines represent only cp pi values between the two cruciviruses, and if both rep and cp pi values are above the threshold, we draw a purple line  that represents an average of both!

Once you have the generated window, right click on nodes(circles) or edges(lines) to get additional data, click and drag to move the image around and scroll to zoom in or out!
